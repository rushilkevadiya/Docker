1️⃣ What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform used to build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers.

It allows developers to package an application along with its libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, ensuring the application runs consistently across different systems.

2️⃣ Why Docker is Needed?

Before Docker, applications faced issues like:

* Dependency conflicts
* Different OS environments
* Difficult deployment
* “Works on my machine” problem

Docker solves these problems by providing a standardized runtime environment, making applications portable and reliable.

3️⃣ What is Containerization?

Containerization is a lightweight virtualization method where applications run in isolated user spaces called containers while sharing the host operating system kernel.

Each container:

* Has its own filesystem
* Has its own processes
* Is isolated from other containers

4️⃣ Docker vs Virtual Machine

| Virtual Machine       | Docker Container      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Requires full OS      | Shares host OS        |
| Heavy and slow        | Lightweight and fast  |
| Uses more resources   | Uses fewer resources  |
| Startup takes minutes | Startup takes seconds |

5️⃣ Docker Architecture 

Docker follows a client-server architecture.

Main Components:

1. Docker Client
The interface used by users to interact with Docker.

2. Docker Daemon
The background service that builds, runs, and manages containers.

3. Docker Image
A read-only template used to create containers.

4. Docker Container
A running instance of an image.

5. Docker Registry
A storage location for Docker images (example: Docker Hub).

6️⃣ Docker Image 

A Docker Image is a blueprint for creating containers.

Characteristics:

* Read-only
* Contains application code and dependencies
* Built in layers
* Stored in Docker registries

7️⃣ Docker Container 

A Docker Container is a runtime instance of a Docker image.

Characteristics:

* Lightweight
* Isolated
* Can be started, stopped, or deleted
* Uses host OS kernel

8️⃣ Difference Between Image and Container

| Docker Image       | Docker Container |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Blueprint          | Running instance |
| Static             | Dynamic          |
| Cannot be modified | Can be modified  |
| Stored in registry | Runs in memory   |

9️⃣ Dockerfile 

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

Purpose:

* Automates image creation
* Ensures consistency
* Defines environment and dependencies
* Each instruction creates a layer, which improves build efficiency through caching.

🔟 Docker Layers Concept

Docker images are built using layers:

* Each instruction adds a new layer
* Layers are cached
* Only changed layers are rebuilt
* This makes Docker fast and efficient.

1️⃣1️⃣ Docker Volume 

By default, container data is temporary.

Docker Volumes are used to:

* Persist data
* Share data between containers
* Store data outside containers
* Volumes exist independently of container lifecycle.

1️⃣2️⃣ Docker Networking 

Docker provides networking to allow containers to:

* Communicate with each other
* Communicate with external systems

Types of networks:

* Bridge
* Host
* Overlay

Networking enables microservices architecture.

1️⃣3️⃣ Docker Compose 

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications using a single configuration file.

Advantages:

* Simplifies multi-container setup
* Improves maintainability
* Supports service dependency management

1️⃣4️⃣ Docker Hub 

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry used to:

* Store Docker images
* Share images
* Pull official images

It acts as a central repository for Docker images.

1️⃣5️⃣ Docker in Real-World Applications

Docker is widely used for:

* Web application deployment
* Microservices
* Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
* Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* DevOps workflows

1️⃣6️⃣ Advantages of Docker

* Platform independent
* Faster deployment
* Better resource utilization
* Easy scalability
* Improved collaboration

1️⃣7️⃣ Limitations of Docker

* Not suitable for GUI-based apps
* Security depends on host OS
* Requires container orchestration for large systems

1️⃣8️⃣ Docker vs Kubernetes

| Docker             | Kubernetes              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Container creation | Container orchestration |
| Single node focus  | Multi-node management   |
| Simple             | Complex but powerful    |

1️⃣9️⃣ Docker Security 

Docker provides:

* Process isolation
* Resource control
* Namespaces and cgroups

However, container security depends on proper configuration.
